```
Status: ✅ MONITORING
Current Phase: Waiting for scraper to complete
```

**What it will do (automatically):**
1. ⏰ Monitor scraper progress every minute
2. 🧠 Generate 30+ additional strategies once rulings reach 1,000
3. 🏗️ Build strategy/ruling/category pages
4. 🚀 Commit to Git and deploy to Vercel

## 🔍 Check Progress Anytime

### From terminal:
```bash
# See how many rulings have been scraped
npm run db:verify

# Check scraper logs
# (Find process ID from above, currently 4664ae)
```

### What's logged:
- Ruling count every 100 rulings
- Progress reports with ETA
- Strategy generation status
- Build completion confirmation

---

## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### Scraper stops unexpectedly:
- ✅ **Auto-resume:** Just run `npm run db:scrape-rulings` again
- It skips already-scraped rulings
- Picks up where it left off

### Orchestrator fails:
- ✅ **Manual fallback:**
  ```bash
  npm run db:verify  # Check what's done
  npm run db:seed-strategies  # Generate strategies manually
  git add -A && git commit -m "overnight build" && git push
  ```

### Nothing to worry about:
- All data is safely stored in Supabase
- Scripts are idempotent (safe to re-run)
- No destructive operations
